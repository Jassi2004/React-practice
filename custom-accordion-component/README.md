Problem Statement:

"Design and implement a custom Accordion component in React from scratch. The component should display a list of sections where each section has a header and collapsible content. When a header is clicked, the corresponding content should expand, and clicking it again should collapse it. Optionally, consider supporting either multiple sections being open at the same time or only one open at a time.

Think about the following aspects:

State Management: How will you manage the open/closed state for each section?
Reusability: How can you make the component flexible enough to accept custom content for both headers and bodies?
Accessibility: How will you ensure that the component is keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly? (For example, consider using appropriate ARIA attributes.)
Styling: Although you donâ€™t need to create a full design, outline how you might style the component to allow for theme customization."

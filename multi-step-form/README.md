Problem Statement (Interview Style):

"Imagine you're building a user onboarding flow for a platform that requires collecting information in multiple steps. You can't overwhelm the user with too many fields at once, but you also need to ensure that they don't submit incomplete or incorrect data. How would you design a solution where users can progress through different stages of a form smoothly, with proper validation, state management, and a seamless user experience? Think about how you'd handle navigation between steps, validation, and ensuring that data isn't lost when moving back and forth."

Follow-up Questions:

How would you structure the form state to persist data across steps?
What validation strategies would you implement to ensure correctness without frustrating the user?
How would you improve the UX to make the transition between steps smooth and intuitive?
Can you optimize the performance of the form for large-scale applications?
